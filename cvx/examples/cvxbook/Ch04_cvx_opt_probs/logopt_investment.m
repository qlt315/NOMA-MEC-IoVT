% 
% The investment strategy x that maximizes the long term growth rate 
%           R = sum_{j=1}^m pi_j*log(p_j^Tx) 
% is called the log-optimal investment strategy, and can be found by
% solving the optimization problem 
%           maximize    sum_{j=1}^m pi_j log(p_j^Tx) 
%           subject to  x >= 0, sum(x) = 1,
% where p_ij is the return of asset i over one period in scenario j and 
% pi_j is the probability of scenario j. There are n assets and m scenarios.
% We consider the case of equiprobable scenarios. 
%
% The log-optimal long term growth rate is found and compared to the one
% obtained with a uniform allocation strategy, i.e., x_i=(1/n). 
% Sample trajectories ofthe accumulated wealth for the optimal strategy and 
% the uniform one are plotted.
