% Sparse covariance estimation for Gaussian variables

% Suppose y \in\reals^n is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and 
% covariance matrix R = \Expect(yy^T), with sparse inverse S = R^{-1} 
% (S_ij = 0 means that y_i and y_j are conditionally independent).
% We want to estimate the covariance matrix R based on N independent 
% samples y1,...,yN drawn from the distribution, and using prior knowledge 
% that S is sparse
% A good heuristic for estimating R is to solve the problem 
%           maximize    logdet(S) - tr(SY) 
%           subject to  sum(sum(abs(S))) <= alpha 
%                       S >= 0
% where Y is the sample covariance of y1,...,yN, and alpha is a sparsity
% parameter to be chosen or tuned.

Strue = sprandsym(n,0.5,0.01,1);
