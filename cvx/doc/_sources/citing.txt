Citing CVX
==========

If you are actively using CVX in teaching, research, or applications, and havenâ€™t yet told
us about it, please do so! Drop us an email at `CVX Research Support <mailto:support@cvxr.com>`_.
It is truly encouraging to hear about new uses for CVX, and we like to keep track of
geographic and technical diversity of our user base. And of course, it is always a
pleasure to receive an email at CVX Research Support that is not a bug report!

Are you using CVX in research work to be published? If so, please include explicit mention of our work in your publication. We suggest language such as this:

	To solve problem (17) we used ``CVX``, a package for specifying and solving convex programs [1],[2].
	
with the following corresponding entries in your bibliography:

	CVX Research, Inc. CVX: Matlab software for disciplined convex programming, 
	version 2.0. ``http://cvxr.com/cvx``, April 2011.
	
	M. Grant and S. Boyd. Graph implementations for nonsmooth convex programs, Recent 
	Advances in Learning and Control (a tribute to M. Vidyasagar), V. Blondel, S. Boyd, 
	and H. Kimura, editors, pages 95-110, Lecture Notes in Control and Information 
	Sciences, Springer, 2008. http://stanford.edu/~boyd/graph_dcp.html.
