SDPT3 4.0
MATLAB software for semidefinite-quadratic-linear programming
Kim-Chuan Toh, Michael J. Todd, and Reha H. Tutuncu

Installation
------------

To build the executable mex-files from the c-files,
the most direct method is to run the MATLAB script file

>> install_sdpt3 

SDPT3 comes with binaries compiled for 32- and 64-bit
flavors of Mac, Linux, and PC. If for some reason these
MEX files do not work for you (for instance if you have a
very old version of MATLAB), you may need to recompile.
To do so, type this command:

>> install_sdpt3 -rebuild

You will need to have compilers installed, and MEX will
need to be configured to work with those compilers. 
Unfortunately we cannot offer assistance with this.

Paths
-----

The installation script may add one or more directories to
your MATLAB path if they are not already present. If so,
you will need to save your path if you wish to use SDPT3
between sessions. To do so, use the command

>> savepath

or use the "Save Path..." option in the GUI.

Demo
----

To test your installation, run the following command:

>> sqlpdemo

Octave Support
--------------

(Michael C. Grant) Observant users will notice apparent
support for Octave in install_sdpt3. I am attempting to make
SDPT3 compatible with Octave 3.8 or later. This support is
at the moment completely unsupported. Use with caution.
